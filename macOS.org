#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
Creating Ethereum, Bitcoin and other accounts is complex and fraught with potential for loss of funds.

All Crypto wallets start with a "Seed": a large, random number used to generate all of the actual
Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. wallets.  

The best practice for using these wallets is to load this "Seed" into a secure hardware device, like
a Trezor hardware wallet.  SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards contain the recovery words, which are typed directly
into the Trezor device to recover the Seed, and all of its accounts.

The [[https://github.com/pjkundert/python-slip39/releases][macOS SLIP-39 App]] helps you generate Mnemonic cards and back up this seed, securely and
reliably, by distributing Mnemonic cards for the seed to partners, family and friends.  Also,
encrypted "Paper Wallets" can be output, to support software cryptocurrency wallets such as
Metamask, Brave or various mobile phone wallets.

Later, if you (or your heirs!) need to recover the accounts, they can collect a sufficient threshold
of the cards and regain access to all of the cryptocurrency accounts related to the seed.

* Security with Availability

  For both BIP-39 and SLIP-39, a 128-bit or 256-bit random "Seed" is the source of an unlimited sequence of
  Ethereum HD Wallet accounts.  Anyone who can obtain this Seed gains control of all Ethereum,
  Bitcoin (and other) accounts derived from it, so it must be securely stored.

  Losing this Seed means that all of the HD Wallet accounts are permanently lost.  Therefore, it
  must be backed up reliably, and be readily accessible.

  Therefore, we must:

  - Ensure that nobody untrustworthy can recover the seed, but
  - Store the seed in many places with several (some perhaps untrustworthy) people.

  How can we address these conflicting requirements?

** SLIP-39 Mnemonic Recovery Cards

   We don't recommend writing down one BIP-39 12-word or 24-word Mnemonic phrase, and hoping that
   *you* can find it, but that nobody else *ever* finds it!

   Instead, generate a number of SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, which can be collected to recover the Seed:

** Paper Wallets

   If desired, you can produce encrypted Paper Wallets, to support software crypto wallets
   (eg. Metamask, Brave or various mobile phone wallets):

* Affiliate Links

  To assist you in obtaining various SLIP-39 compatible components, we have established some
  relationship with reliable vendors.

** Trezor

   The [[https://shop.trezor.io/product/trezor-model-t?offer_id=15&aff_id=10388][Trezor Model T hardware wallet]] has built-in SLIP-39 generation and recovery capability.

** Netcoins.app

   In Canada, one of the more highly regulatory-compliant Cryptocurrency exchanges is [[https://netcoins.app/r?ac=5YO1MZ][Netcoins.app]];
   sign up with this referral link, and we both get some benefits.

   They have higher than typical Interac e-transfer limits, which is very nice.  However, they don't
   support a wide range of cryptocurrencies; presently, only BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, USDC, and a
   few other lesser-known coins.

** Crypto.com

   Use my referral link for [[https://crypto.com/app/2x4hk92dnf][Crypto.com]] to sign up for Crypto.com and we both get $25 USD :)

   The Crypto.com exchange has many more coins available, as well as a crypto-funded credit card
   that presently works in Canada.
