Creating Ethereum, Bitcoin and other accounts is complex and fraught
with potential for loss of funds.

All Crypto wallets start with a "Seed": a large, random number used to
generate all of the actual Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. wallets.

The best practice for using these wallets is to load this "Seed" into a
secure hardware device, like a Trezor hardware wallet.  SLIP-39 Mnemonic
cards contain the recovery words, which are typed directly into the
Trezor device to recover the Seed, and all of its accounts.

The [macOS SLIP-39 App] helps you generate Mnemonic cards and back up
this seed, securely and reliably, by distributing Mnemonic cards for the
seed to partners, family and friends.  Also, encrypted "Paper Wallets"
can be output, to support software cryptocurrency wallets such as
Metamask, Brave or various mobile phone wallets.

Later, if you (or your heirs!) need to recover the accounts, they can
collect a sufficient threshold of the cards and regain access to all of
the cryptocurrency accounts related to the seed.

1 Security with Availability
════════════════════════════

  For both BIP-39 and SLIP-39, a 128-bit or 256-bit random "Seed" is the
  source of an unlimited sequence of Ethereum HD Wallet accounts.
  Anyone who can obtain this Seed gains control of all Ethereum, Bitcoin
  (and other) accounts derived from it, so it must be securely stored.

  Losing this Seed means that all of the HD Wallet accounts are
  permanently lost.  Therefore, it must be backed up reliably, and be
  readily accessible.

  Therefore, we must:

  • Ensure that nobody untrustworthy can recover the seed, but
  • Store the seed in many places with several (some perhaps
    untrustworthy) people.

  How can we address these conflicting requirements?


1.1 SLIP-39 Mnemonic Recovery Cards
───────────────────────────────────

  We don't recommend writing down one BIP-39 12-word or 24-word Mnemonic
  phrase, and hoping that *you* can find it, but that nobody else *ever*
  finds it!

  Instead, generate a number of SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, which can be
  collected to recover the Seed:

1.2 Paper Wallets
─────────────────

  If desired, you can produce encrypted Paper Wallets, to support
  software crypto wallets (eg. Metamask, Brave or various mobile phone
  wallets):

═════════════════

  To assist you in obtaining various SLIP-39 compatible components, we
  have established some relationship with reliable vendors.


2.1 Trezor
──────────

  The [Trezor Model T hardware wallet] has built-in SLIP-39 generation
  and recovery capability.

2.2 Netcoins.app
────────────────

  In Canada, one of the more highly regulatory-compliant Cryptocurrency
  exchanges is [Netcoins.app]; sign up with this referral link, and we
  both get some benefits.

  They have higher than typical Interac e-transfer limits, which is very
  nice.  However, they don't support a wide range of cryptocurrencies;
  presently, only BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, USDC, and a few other
  lesser-known coins.

2.3 Crypto.com
──────────────

  Use my referral link for [Crypto.com] to sign up for Crypto.com and we
  both get $25 USD :)

  The Crypto.com exchange has many more coins available, as well as a
  crypto-funded credit card that presently works in Canada.
