Creating Ethereum, Bitcoin and other accounts is complex and fraught
with potential for loss of funds.

All Crypto wallets start with a "Seed": a large, random number used to
generate all of the actual Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. wallets.

The best practice for using these wallets is to load this "Seed" into a
secure hardware device, like a Trezor hardware wallet.  SLIP39 Mnemonic
cards contain the recovery words, which are typed directly into the
Trezor device to recover the Seed, and all of its accounts.

The macOS SLIP39 app helps you generate Mnemonic cards and back up this
seed, securely and reliably, by distributing Mnemonic cards for the seed
to partners, family and friends.

Later, if you (or your heirs!) need to recover the accounts, they can
collect a sufficient threshold of the cards and regain access to the
account.

  For both BIP-39 and SLIP-39, a 128-bit or 256-bit random "Seed" is the
  source of an unlimited sequence of Ethereum HD Wallet accounts.
  Anyone who can obtain this Seed gains control of all Ethereum, Bitcoin
  (and other) accounts derived from it, so it must be securely stored.

  Losing this Seed means that all of the HD Wallet accounts are
  permanently lost.  Therefore, it must be backed up reliably, and be
  readily accessible.

  Therefore, we must:

  • Ensure that nobody untrustworthy can recover the seed, but
  • Store the seed in many places with several (some perhaps
    untrustworthy) people.

  How can we address these conflicting requirements?


1.1 SLIP-39 Mnemonic Recovery Cards
───────────────────────────────────

  We don't recommend writing down one BIP-39 12-word or 24-word Mnemonic
  phrase, and hoping that *you* can find it, but that nobody else *ever*
  finds it!

  Instead, generate a number of SLIP-39 Mnemonic cards, which can be
  collected to recover the Seed:
